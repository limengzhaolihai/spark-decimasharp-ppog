            num_executors (int): number of simulated executors. More executors
                means a higher possible level of parallelism.
            job_arrival_rate (float): non-negative number that controls how
                quickly new jobs arrive into the system. This is the parameter
                of an exponential distributions, and so its inverse is the
                mean job inter-arrival time in ms.
            moving_delay (float): time in ms it takes for a executor to move
                between jobs
            warmup_delay (float): an executor is slower on its first task from
                a stage if it was previously idle or moving jobs, which is
                caputred by adding a warmup delay to the task duration
            dataset (str): choice of dataset to generate jobs from. Currently,
                only 'tpch' is supported.
            beta (float): continuous discount factor in [0,+inf). If set to 0,
                then rewards are not discounted.
            job_arrival_cap: (optional int): limit on the number of jobs that
                arrive throughout the simulation. If set to `None`, then the
                episode ends when a time limit is reached.
